# M4a-to-MP3
This is a script I wrote to convert itunes music to mp3's. I used this after my grandfather messaged me when I was in a long car trip and decided to make my own tool instead of using somebody elses. It's not the most efficient way to fix this problem but for a 20-40 minute job I'm proud of what I made
